# Genealogical Database Manager for GEDCOM database

ChainPro started in around 2000 as a C# program when no adequate [GEDCOM](https://www.gedcom.org/) based managers were available. It was subsequently turned into a java-8 with javafx based project, and updated to a modular Java-17 project over the past month (June 2023).

Initially, this repository serves mainly for version control and management, but I hope to gradually turn it into a full featured Open Source Project.
