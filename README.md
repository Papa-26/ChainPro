# ChainPro
Genealogical Database Manager for GEDCOM database

ChainPro started in around 2000 as a C# program when no adequate GEDCOM based managers were available. It was subsequently turned into a java-8 with javafx based project, and updated to a modular Java-17 project over the past month (June 2023)
