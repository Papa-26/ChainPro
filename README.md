# Genealogical Database Manager for GEDCOM database

ChainPro started in around 2000 as a C# program when no adequate, open-source [GEDCOM](https://www.gedcom.org/) based managers were available. It was subsequently turned into a java-8 with javafx based project, and updated to a modular Java-17 project over the past month (June 2023).

ChainPro has over the years helped my wife and me to build up an illustrated, 8000 member family tree, reaching back to the 16th century.

Initially, this repository serves mainly for version control and management, but I hope to gradually turn it into a full fledged Open Source Project.
